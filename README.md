## Course Breakdown

### Week 1: Fundamentals of LLMs

- Explored core concepts and effective utilization of large language models.

### Week 2: Gradio UI Framework & Agentization

- Delved into the Gradio UI Framework, multi-modality, and working with frontier models.

### Week 3: Open Source Models on Hugging Face

- Examined various models including Llama3.1, Qwen, and others available on Hugging Face.

### Week 4: LLM Selection & Benchmarks

- Learned to select the right LLMs for different tasks using leaderboards and benchmarking techniques.

### Week 5: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Built a Q&A chatbot, **Nick’s FlirtAI Chatbot**, that offers fun flirting tips.
- Powered by GPT-4o and a vector database.
